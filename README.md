In this project I will make a recipe website where I
practice all of the lessons I have learned so far using
the Odin Project.

I plan to practice the following elements and attributes:

- Setting up a boilerplate
- Heading and Paragraph elements
- Use Strong and Em tags
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Use Anchor elements to create absolute and relative links
- Image links with alt text
- Practive making good, clear git commit messages

I intend to ensure compliance with best practice standards
in my website code.
