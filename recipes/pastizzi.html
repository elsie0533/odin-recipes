      Pastizzi (or, a singular pastizz) are small pastries made with a crispy,
      flaky dough and typically stuffed with fillings of ricotta cheese.
      Pastizzi are typically savoury, but can be filled with anything!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>200 gm whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>50 gm unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>6 sheets of phyllo pastry</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 220Â°C. In a small bowl, combine the ricotta and the egg.
        Mix until the egg is well incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working one sheet at a time and keeping the remainder of the phyllo
        pastry covered under a damp tea towel, lay a sheet of pastry on a clean
        work surface and brush liberally with butter. Gently top with another
        sheet of pastry, brush with butter and repeat until all 6 sheets have
        been used. Do not brush butter over the top sheet of pastry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a 10cm wide circular cutter, cut 10 circles out of the prepared
        dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working one circle at a time, spoon a tablespoon of ricotta filling into
        the centre of the circle. Fold the circle in half over the filling and
        pinch the ends together. Flatten the bottom on the work surface and
        transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining
        dough circles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush the formed pastizzi with remaining melted butter and then transfer
        to the oven. Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the pastry is a deep
        golden brown and the filling is puffed. Allow to cool for 5 minutes
        before eating.
      </li>
    </ol>
