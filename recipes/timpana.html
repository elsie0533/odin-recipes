      <li>300 gm straight macaroni pasta</li>
      <li>2 hard boiled eggs, peeled</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>80 gm parmesan cheese grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Shortcrust Pastry</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>450 gm plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
      <li>210gm unsalted butter, chilled and diced, plus some for greasing</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Score the bottom of the tomatoes and grate them on a box grater.</li>
      <li>
        Sauté the onion and garlic in the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat
        for 5 minutes. Add the minced meat and pancetta and cook until the meat
        has browned and any moisture has evaporated. Add the tomatoes, tomato
        paste, stock, spices and some salt and pepper and bring to the boil.
        Cover with a lid and simmer the ragu for 45 minutes. Scrape into a bowl
        to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a frying pan, sauté the liver in the butter over a medium heat until
        the pieces are seared all over but still pink in the middle. Season with
        salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil the pasta in well-salted water for a few minutes less than the
        packet recommends. Drain and rinse with cold water to cool the pasta
        down.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk 3 eggs in a large mixing bowl, then stir in the parmesan. Mix in
        the pasta, followed by the ragu and chicken livers. The pasta should not
        be as wet as a normal pasta with sauce, but should not be too dry
        either. Refrigerate until completely chilled
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta mixture is chilling, make the pastry. Combine the flour,
        butter and salt in a bowl and rub together with your fingertips until
        the mixture resembles breadcrumbs or rough sand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the water to create a firm dough. Shape into a ball, then flatten
        into a disc. Cover in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 45
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 180°C and butter a large, tall non-stick springform
        cake tin (about 10 cm high and 24 cm wide).
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out the pastry on a floured surface to 5 mm (1/4 in) thick. Line
        the tin with the pastry, then trim off the excess and form the scraps
        into a ball to use for the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill the pastry shell with half the pasta mixture. Scatter with the
        wedges of boiled egg, and top with the remaining pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out the remaining pastry and cover the pie. Trim off the excess
        pastry leaving a small border. Fold in and use a thumb to make
        decorative indentations around the edge. Whisk the egg with the milk and
        brush over the top of the timpana.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the oven for 45 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the
        pie, remove the springform sides and cook for another 15 minutes.
      </li>
